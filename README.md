# 🎫 Discord Modals Simple Ticket Bot

This is a bot infrastructure I created in my spare time. Initially, I made it for my own server, but I decided to share it with the community in hopes that it will be useful to others. Happy coding!

## 🚀 Setup Guide
Now, there's a video tutorial to help you set up the bot! Watch it here: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/gv94bxO-jo0)

### Prerequisites
📌 You must have **Node.js** installed on your computer. If you haven't installed it yet, download it from [here](https://nodejs.org).

### Installation Steps
1️⃣ Open a terminal and run:
   ```sh
   npm install -g yarn
   ```
   This will install Yarn globally.

2️⃣ Navigate to the bot's directory, open a terminal, and install the required modules:
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

3️⃣ Open the **config.js** file and fill in the necessary details.

4️⃣ Once everything is set up, start the bot by running:
   ```sh
   node src/index.js
   ```
   Alternatively, you can create a `.bat` file with the command above to start the bot without opening a terminal.
